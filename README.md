# hello-world


I float in an ocean of blood, keeping my eyes above the sea level.
The boats float around with no intention of help.
I wish there was something I could do about all the people drowning below, though I had no boat of my own.
The drowning get collected, locked up and hidden away.
Massive prisons set on the rock bottom floor, no way of coming back up.
